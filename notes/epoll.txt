EPOLLLT		- Level Triggering (default)
			- You will get an event as long as that event's condition
			  is true (i.e. as long as there is data to read, you will
			  know....will trigger when you HAVE data)

EPOLLET		- Edge Triggering
			- You only get an event the first time the conditionis true
			  (i.e. will trigger when you GET data)
			- should read until errno == EAGAIN || EWOULDBLOCK
			- all previously blocking calls (send, recv, accept) need
			  to be called in a loop
			- for accept, every call that doesn't receive -1 is a new client
				- If it is a -1, check the error

* General rule...Level Trigger your server sockets and Edge Trigger your client sockets
