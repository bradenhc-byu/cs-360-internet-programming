FUNCTIONS TO REMEMBER

int socket() - creates a socket

connect() - connects the socket to the given address/port

bind() - sets the source address and port (called after the socket is made)

listen() - converts the socket into a listening socket...waits for others to connect

accept() - always used with listen...it allows a client
